This project is a playful, autumn-themed login page inspired by a design from [Outcrowd Studio](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtOihF5ONQj/). 
The page features a black cat whose eyes follow a falling leaf and looks away when the password field is clicked.

I built it as a short 3-day project while experimenting with web coding for the first time and exploring how design translates into front-end implementation. 
The concept was influenced by the fall scenery in Ohio and the color palette of [Trader Joe's Trick-or-Treat Mini Canvas Totes](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/trick-or-treat-mini-canvas-totes-081415), using shades of orange, purple, and black to create a warm and cozy atmosphere.

Through this project, I learned how to structure and style a page using HTML and CSS, as well as how to bring design intent to life through animation and layout.
